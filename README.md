============

A very simple irc bot in python... 
Yet another Python exercise in sockets and threading that I wrote for myself very hastily to bookmark links that were pasted into a music appreciation chatroom.

This is a bare-bones irc bot. It is not solid, robust, or many other terms implying that it is at all good. It works well and is useful for me, but doesn't mean that it will be for you. However you may (or may not) find it useful, educationally, as a reference of something you could do in Python. 

Any extra features that were added after the initial features of idling on irc and logging links are purely bonus and were written hastily as well. Lots of improvements could be made in this bot - better threading structure, use of properties, etc. This repository or any forks are NOT the place to put these improvements. Use this educationally, and make your own (better) bot! (You don't have to keep the license attached in that case.)  :)
